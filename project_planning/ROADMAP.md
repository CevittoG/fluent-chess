Phase 1: Core Functionality (1-2 weeks)

Focus: Building the foundation using "Fluent Python" concepts.
Tasks:
Object-Oriented Design:
Define classes for ChessPiece, Board, and Game using OOP principles.
Implement basic functionalities like piece movement validation, board state management, and move checking.
User Interface (UI):
Choose a suitable library like Pygame or Tkinter.
Develop a basic chess board visualization with squares, pieces, and highlighting for valid moves.
AI Implementation:
Choose a basic AI algorithm like Minimax or Alpha-Beta Pruning.
Implement the core logic for evaluating possible moves and selecting the best one based on the chosen algorithm.
Phase 2: Move Analysis and Logging (1-2 weeks)

Focus: Integrating move analysis and logging.
Tasks:
Move Analysis:
Expand the AI code to track and store additional information during move evaluation.
Identify and store the top 5 potential moves for the AI based on their evaluation scores.
Analyze each potential move:
Identify pieces captured or threatened.
Calculate potential control over key squares.
Assign justification labels (e.g., "Capture", "Threat", "Control").
Logging:
Implement functionalities to save and load game logs in a structured format (e.g., text file or JSON).
Include information in the log like:
Player moves.
AI-suggested improvements for each move.
Justifications for suggested improvements.
Phase 3: Visualization and User Interaction (2-3 weeks)

Focus: Enhancing the user experience through visualization and interaction.
Tasks:
Visualization:
Design and implement visual elements for displaying:
Top 5 potential moves:
Highlight corresponding squares on the board with varying intensities based on their "goodness."
Evaluation breakdown for each move:
Create panels showing the piece to be moved, target square, evaluation score, and justification.
Employ visual representations like bar graphs or numbers for evaluation scores.
Implement animations for a smooth "thinking" effect by fading and filling visual elements.
User Interaction:
Allow hovering over highlighted squares and evaluation panels for detailed explanations.
Consider offering an optional view of a simplified version of the evaluation tree, if computationally feasible.
Testing and Refinement (Throughout Development):

Continuously test the developed functionalities throughout each phase.
Address bugs and refine code based on testing results.
Gather feedback from potential users to improve user experience and overall design.
Additional Considerations:

Refer to "Fluent Python" for guidance on implementing the various functionalities in Python effectively.
Manage project complexity by breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
Utilize version control systems like Git to track code changes and facilitate collaboration (if applicable).
